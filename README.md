I am a working professional and student who is interested in Cybersecurity and technology. I am dedicated to solving complex problems.




My journey in Cybersecurity and GRC has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
