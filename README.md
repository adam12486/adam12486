I am a working professional and student who is interested in Cybersecurity and technology. I am dedicated to solving complex problems.




My journey in Cybersecurity and GRC has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst. I currently work as a Quality Assurance Specialist for a CAR-T cell therapy program in Pharma. The program I work in is software and technology dependent to which I oversight system applications, workflow recipe's, and assist in troubleshooting workflow errors. Working with next generation systems that optimize the workflows of our operations attributed to my passion for security, systems and technology.
